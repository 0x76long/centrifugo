Depending on transport endpoint address can differ. For example Centrifugo JSON-encoded Websocket endpoint is \nws://centrifugo.example.com/connection/websocket\n.\n\n\nsubscribe on channels developer wants. This allows to recieve messages published into channels in real-time.\n\n\nhave a possibility to make RPC calls, publish, asking for presence etc.\n\n\nrefresh client connection credentials when connection session lifetime is going to expire.\n\n\nhandle ping/pong messaging with server under the hood to maintain connection alive and detect broken connection.\n\n\nhandle protocol-specific errors, reconnect and recover missed messages automatically.\n\n\n\n\nAt moment Centrifuge/Centrifugo can work with several transports:\n\n\n\n\nWebsocket\n\n\nSockJS\n\n\nGRPC\n\n\n\n\nThis document describes protocol specifics for Websocket transport which supports binary and text formats to transfer data. As Centrifuge has various types of messages it serializes protocol messages using JSON or Protobuf (in case of binary websockets).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSockJS works almost the same way as JSON websocket described here but has its own extra framing on top of Centrifuge protocol messages. SockJS can only work with JSON - it's not possible to transfer binary data over it. SockJS is only needed as fallback to Websocket in web browsers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGRPC support is an experimental at moment. GRPC works similar to what described here but it has its own transport details - Centrifuge library can not control how data travel over network and just uses GRPC generated API to pass messages between server and client over bidirectional streaming.\n\n\n\n\nTop level framing\n\u00b6\n\n\nCentrifuge protocol defined in \nProtobuf schema\n. That schema is a source of truth and all protocol description below describes messages from that schema.\n\n\nClient sends \nCommand\n to server.\n\n\nServer sends \nReply\n to client.\n\n\nOne request from client to server and one response from server to client can have more than one \nCommand\n or \nReply\n.\n\n\nWhen JSON format is used then many \nCommand\n can be sent from client to server in JSON streaming line-delimited format. I.e. many commands delimited by new line symbol \n\\n\n.\n\n\n{\n\"id\"\n:\n \n1\n,\n \n\"method\"\n:\n \n\"subscribe\"\n,\n \n\"params\"\n:\n \n{\n\"channel\"\n:\n \n\"ch1\"\n}}\n\n\n{\n\"id\"\n:\n \n2\n,\n \n\"method\"\n:\n \n\"subscribe\"\n,\n \n\"params\"\n:\n \n{\n\"channel\"\n:\n \n\"ch2\"\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis doc will use JSON format for examples because it's human-readable. Everything said here for JSON is also true for Protobuf encoded case. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nMethod is made as ENUM in protobuf schema and can be sent as integer value but it's possible to send it as string in JSON case \u2013 this was made to make JSON protocol human-friendly.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Protobuf format is used then many \nCommand\n can be sent from client to server in length-delimited format where each individual \nCommand\n marshaled to bytes prepended by \nvarint\n length.\n\n\nThe same relates to many \nReply\n in one response from server to client.

In this case client implementation should look at \nttl\n value which is seconds left until connection will be considered expired. Client must send \nrefresh\n command after this \nttl\n seconds.

Note that there is no \nid\n field in this message - this symptom\nallows to distinguish it from \nReply\n to \nCommand\n.  \n\n\nNext message is \nJoin\n message:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"result\"\n:\n{\n\n        \n\"type\"\n:\n1\n,\n\n        \n\"channel\"\n:\n\"ch1\"\n,\n\n        \n\"data\"\n:\n{\n\n            \n\"info\"\n:\n{\n\n                \n\"user\"\n:\n\"2694\"\n,\n\n                \n\"client\"\n:\n\"5c48510e-cf49-4fa8-a9b2-490b22231e74\"\n,\n\n                \n\"conn_info\"\n:\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Alexander\"\n},\n\n                \n\"chan_info\"\n:\n{}\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin\n messages sent when someone joined (subscribed on) channel.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nTo enable \nJoin\n and \nLeave\n messages \njoin_leave\n option must be enabled on server globally or for channel namespace.\n\n\n\n\nLeave\n messages sent when someone left (unsubscribed from) channel.\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"result\"\n:\n{\n\n        \n\"type\"\n:\n2\n,\n\n        \n\"channel\"\n:\n\"ch1\"\n,\n\n        \n\"data\"\n:\n{\n\n            \n\"info\"\n:\n{\n\n                \n\"user\"\n:\n\"2694\"\n,\n\n                \n\"client\"\n:\n\"5c48510e-cf49-4fa8-a9b2-490b22231e74\"\n,\n\n                \n\"conn_info\"\n:\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Alexander\"\n},\n\n                \n\"chan_info\"\n:\n{}\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally \nUnsub\n message that means that server unsubscribed current client from channel:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"result\"\n:\n{\n\n        \n\"type\"\n:\n3\n,\n\n        \n\"channel\"\n:\n\"ch1\"\n,\n\n        \n\"data\"\n:\n{}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's possible to distinguish between different types of asynchronous messages looking at \ntype\n field (for \nPublication\n this field not set or \n0\n).\n\n\nPing Pong\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo maintain connection alive and detect broken connections client must periodically send \nping\n commands to server and expect replies to it. Ping command looks like:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"id\"\n:\n32\n,\n\n    \n\"method\"\n:\n\"ping\"\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nServer just echoes this command back. When client does not receive ping reply for some time it must consider connection broken and try to reconnect. Recommended ping interval is 25 seconds, recommended period to wait for pong is 1-5 seconds. Though those numbers can vary.\n\n\nHandle disconnects\n\u00b6\n\n\nClient should handle disconnect advices from server. In websocket case disconnect advice is sent in reason field of CLOSE Websocket frame. Reason contains string which is \ndisconnect\n object encoded into JSON (even in case of Protobuf scenario). That objects looks like:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"reason\"\n:\n \n\"shutdown\"\n,\n\n    \n\"reconnect\"\n:\n \ntrue\n \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIt contains string reason of connection closing and advice to reconnect or not. Client should take this reconnect advice into account.\n\n\nIn case of network problems and random disconnect from server without well known reason client should always try to  reconnect with exponential intervals.\n\n\nHandle errors\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis section contains advices to error handling in client implementations.\n\n\nErrors can happen during various operations and can be handled in special way in context of some commands to tolerate network and server problems.\n\n\nErrors during \nconnect\n must result in full client reconnect.\n\n\nErrors during \nsubscribe\n must result in full client reconnect if error is temporary. And be sent to subscribe error event handler of subscription if received error is persistent. Persistent errors are errors like \npermission denied\n, \nbad request\n, \nnamespace not found\n etc. Persistent errors in most situation mean a mistake from developers side.\n\n\nThe special corner case is client-side timeout during \nsubscribe\n operation. As protocol is asynchronous it's possible in this case that server will eventually subscribe client on channel but client will think that it's not subscribed. It's possible to retry subscription request and tolerate \nalready subscribed\n error as expected. But the simplest solution is to reconnect entirely as this is simpler and gives client a chance to connect to working server instance.\n\n\nErrors during rpc-like operations can be just returned to caller - i.e. user javascript code. Calls like \nhistory\n and \npresence\n are idempotent. You should be accurate with unidempotent operations like \npublish\n - in case of client timeout it's possible to send the same message into channel twice if retry publish after timeout - so if you care about this case make sure you have some protection from displaying message twice on client side (maybe some sort of unique key in payload).",

Note  SockJS works almost the same way as JSON websocket described here but has its own extra framing on top of Centrifuge protocol messages.

Server gives client a configured window to refresh credentials after  ttl  passed and then closes connection if client have not updated its credentials.  expired  field set to  true  when client connection already expired.

            "text": "This section contains advices to error handling in client implementations.  Errors can happen during various operations and can be handled in special way in context of some commands to tolerate network and server problems.  Errors during  connect  must result in full client reconnect.  Errors during  subscribe  must result in full client reconnect if error is temporary. And be sent to subscribe error event handler of subscription if received error is persistent. Persistent errors are errors like  permission denied ,  bad request ,  namespace not found  etc. Persistent errors in most situation mean a mistake from developers side.  The special corner case is client-side timeout during  subscribe  operation. As protocol is asynchronous it's possible in this case that server will eventually subscribe client on channel but client will think that it's not subscribed. It's possible to retry subscription request and tolerate  already subscribed  error as expected. But the simplest solution is to reconnect entirely as this is simpler and gives client a chance to connect to working server instance.  Errors during rpc-like operations can be just returned to caller - i.e. user javascript code. Calls like  history  and  presence  are idempotent. You should be accurate with unidempotent operations like  publish  - in case of client timeout it's possible to send the same message into channel twice if retry publish after timeout - so if you care about this case make sure you have some protection from displaying message twice on client side (maybe some sort of unique key in payload).",
